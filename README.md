# Olympic-Games-Database-Project
<br>
Credits to gitusers JiapengWu, David-Gilbert-cs, and dch133 for their help on creating this DataBase with GUI for our Database class in McGill

This database project done in SQL and Python consisted of defining a simplified Olympic dataset, and we performed many queries and dynamic modifications upon this data set. The end product is a Python GUI that lets the user decide what action to take.

The pdf Project-part1,part2,part3 describe the requirements and restrictions of our project.
